# Status of the Plugin System
While even at this early stage, the Zellij plugin system offers powerful capabilities to plugin developers and users alike, there are a few key missing features that are all currently being addressed. This page lists the major ones:

1. [Plugin commands are asynchronous and provide no success/failure indication](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2558)
2. [More plugin APIs](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2559)
