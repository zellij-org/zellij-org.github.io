      <title>Zellij 0.39.0: Session Resurrection, Cross-Language UI Components, load Plugins from the Web</title>
      <link>https://zellij.dev/news/session-resurrection-ui-components/</link>

      <description>Session Resurrection Zellij now includes built-in session resurrection capabilities. This means that Zellij sessions can be restored after reboots or graceful quits. Attaching to an exited session will resurrect it, allowing users to keep long-running named workspaces. Sessions are serialized as Human readable Zellij layouts, so they can also be shared across machines or between friends.

Special thanks to @AlixBernard for implementing the serialization algorithm, as well as to @alekspickle for helping integrate the algorithm with our code base.</description>

      <title>Zellij 0.38.0: including a session-manager, plugin infrastructure improvements and an end to offensive session names</title>
      <link>https://zellij.dev/news/session-manager-protobuffs/</link>

      <description>Session Manager This much requested feature has been implemented as a built-in plugin, allowing users to switch between sessions and move focus to specific tabs or panes in the current or other sessions. And of course, one can fuzzy-find through pane names (often provided by the application running inside the terminal), tab names or session names.
All of this functionality is now available as part of Zellij&amp;rsquo;s plugin API - so users are welcome and encouraged to fork the plugin and change its behavior to their liking.</description>

      <description>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool to be able to develop terminal applets like UI components? Visual scripts to help you automate your workflow, shareable with others and written in Rust?
The Zellij team has just overhauled our WebAssembly plugin system, and we&amp;rsquo;d like to invite plugin developers to build this with us.
Want to participate in building something new? Don&amp;rsquo;t mind a few rough edges? Please read on!

      <description>We just released Zellij 0.35.1, including an exciting array of new features and bug fixes. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in to some of them!

You can page through them up/down as you would normally move through panes (eg.</description>
