- **[Basic Functionality (Floating Panes + Command Panes + Scrollback Editing)](/tutorials/basic-functionality)**: Here we demonstrate some of the more basic functionality of Zellij and how to use it for everyday tasks.

- **[Stacked Resizes and Pinned Floating Panes](/tutorials/stacked-resize)**: Here we demonstrate some of the more basic functionality of Zellij and how to use it for everyday tasks.

- **[Layouts](/tutorials/layouts)**: This tutorial walks you through creating Zellij [layouts](/documentation/creating-a-layout.html) to automate tasks and workflows.

- **[Session Management](/tutorials/session-management)**: Learn how to use Zellij for session-management to separate different tasks and contexts.

- **[Web Client - Sharing Sessions in the Browser](/tutorials/web-client)**: Here we demonstrate how to use Zellij in the browser in addition or even instead of a dedicated terminal emulator.

- **[Dealing with Colliding Keyboard Shortcuts](/tutorials/colliding-keybindings)**: This tutorial demonstrates how to solve the "Colliding Keybindings" problem, in which the Zellij UI intercepts keys meant for the applications running inside Zellij.

- **[Filepicker](/tutorials/filepicker)**: Stop wasting time traversing through your filesystem manually! Use the Zellij filepicker to get a dynamic file exploration experience, complete with fuzzy-finding and autocompletion right in your terminal.

### [Basic Functionality + Floating Panes + Command Panes + Scrollback Editing](/tutorials/basic-functionality)
[{{<figure src="/img/tutorial-1-preview.png" class="center" style="max-width 995px;">}}](/tutorials/basic-functionality)
Here we demonstrate some of the more basic functionality of Zellij and terminal multiplexers in general.

We'll show how to open multiple terminal tiled and floating panes.

Instead of retyping a command or searching through our shell history, we'll see how we can use Command Panes to keep frequently run commands around.
Finally, we'll talk about editing a pane's scrollback with our own `$EDITOR`

### [Layouts](/tutorials/layouts)
[{{<figure src="/img/tutorial-2-preview.png" class="center" style="max-width 995px;">}}](/tutorials/layouts)

This tutorial walks you through creating Zellij [layouts](/documentation/creating-a-layout.html) to automate tasks and workflows.

Layouts describe a pre-defined set of panes and tabs with different terminals, commands and plugins. They can be great to automate and formalize workflows and tasks.

### [Session Management](/tutorials/session-management)
[{{<figure src="/img/tutorial-3-preview.png" style="max-width 995px;">}}](/tutorials/session-management)
Do you find yourself jumping between tasks a lot?

When using the terminal, we often open new terminal windows for different tasks, ending up with a mess of open terminals. This can lead to difficulty and overhead when switching contexts: we often end up searching for commands through our shell history, keeping complex notes and having to rebuild our environment every time we return to a task. Zellij can solve these problems and more for us with the `session-manager` and `welcome-screen`.

### [Dealing with Colliding Keyboard Shortcuts](/tutorials/colliding-keybindings)
[{{<figure src="/img/configuration-screen-1.png" class="center" style="max-width 995px;">}}](/tutorials/colliding-keybindings)
This tutorial demonstrates how to solve the "Colliding Keybindings" problem, in which the Zellij UI intercepts keys meant for the applications running inside Zellij.

### [Filepicker](/tutorials/filepicker)
[{{<figure src="/img/tutorial-4-preview.png" style="max-width 995px;">}}](/tutorials/filepicker)
Stop wasting time traversing through your filesystem manually!

Use the Zellij filepicker to get a dynamic file exploration experience, complete with fuzzy-finding and autocompletion right in your terminal.
